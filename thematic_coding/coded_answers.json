So input: basic (BSP) geometry, perhaps with some mark-up that indicates design/semantic intentions - output: level that is decorated with details such as slants, trims, pipes, walls with depth, bridges that start and end properly, other procedural geometry, etc. That way, I can stay in control over the overall design of the level, and have the artistic details be figured out by a tool, much like an art director making a request.
