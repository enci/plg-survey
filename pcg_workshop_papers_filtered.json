      "year": 2025,
      "authors": "Mahsa Bazzaz and Seth Cooper",
      "abstract": "This work investigates the role of uncertainty in Slay the Spire using an information-theoretic framework. Focusing on the entropy of game paths (which are based on procedurally-generated maps) we analyze how randomness influences player decision-making and success. By examining a dataset of 20,000 game runs, we quantify the entropy of paths taken by players and relate it with their outcomes and skill levels. The results show that victorious runs are associated with higher normalized entropy, suggesting more risk-taking. Additionally, higher-skill players tend to exhibit distinct patterns of risk-taking behavior in later game stages.",

      "authors": "Kaijie Xu and Clark Verbrugge",
      "abstract": "Procedural Content Generation (PCG) has long enabled efficient and varied game level creation. However, integrating high-level design intentions and game mechanics into complex 3D environments remains challenging. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework that transforms narrative-level descriptions into playable 3D game levels. First, Large Language Models (LLMs) parse natural language descriptions of game environments into a structured Game Level Description Language (GLDL), capturing essential spatial constraints. Next, we model level generation as a Facility Layout Optimization problem, ensuring that facility placements and configurations adhere to specified design criteria. Through comprehensive experiments, including automated constraint evaluations and agent-based simulations, our approach ensures both the feasibility and stability of the constraints extracted from textual descriptions. We confirm that the resulting game levels remain interactive, reasonable, and controllable to their original specifications.",

      "abstract": "Can we replicate the power of evolutionary algorithms in discovering good and diverse game content via generative machine learning (ML) techniques? This question could subvert current trends in procedural content generation (PCG) and beyond. By learning the behavior of quality-diversity (QD) evolutionary algorithms through ML, we stand to overcome the computational challenges inherent in QD search and ensure that the benefits of QD search are reproduced by efficient generative models. We introduce a novel, end-to-end methodology named Machine Learning of Quality Diversity (MLQD) which is executed in two steps. First, tailored QD evolution creates large and diverse training datasets from the ground up. Second, sophisticated ML architectures such as the Transformer learn the datasets? underlying distributions, resulting in generative models that can emulate QD search via stochastic inference. We test MLQD on the use-case of generating strategy game map sketches, a task characterized by stringent constraints and a multidimensional feature space. Our findings are promising, demonstrating that the Transformer architecture can capture both the diversity and the quality traits of the training sets, successfully reproducing the behavior of a range of tested QD algorithms. This marks a significant advancement in our quest to automate the creation of high-quality, diverse game content, pushing the boundaries of what is possible in PCG and generative AI at large.",

      "abstract": "Expressive range analysis is a visualization-based technique used to evaluate the performance of generative models, particularly in game level generation. It typically employs two quantifiable metrics to position generated artifacts on a 2D plot, offering insight into how content is distributed within a defined metric space. In this work, we use the expressive range of a generator as the conceptual space of possible creations. Inspired by the quality diversity paradigm, we explore this space to generate levels. To do so, we use a constraint-based generator that systematically traverses and generates levels in this space. To train the constraint-based generator we use different tile patterns to learn from the initial example levels. We analyze how different patterns influence the exploration of the expressive range. Specifically, we compare the exploration process based on time, the number of successful and failed sample generations, and the overall interestingness of the generated levels. Unlike typical quality diversity approaches that rely on random generation and hope to get good coverage of the expressive range, this approach systematically traverses the grid ensuring more coverage. This helps create unique and interesting game levels while also improving our understanding of the generator?s strengths and limitations.",

Despite advances in procedural techniques, little is known about their impact on long-term system maintenance. We explore how Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) can help improve procedural level design processes, and support maintenance by integrating level design sketches into generator-agnostic tools. This short paper examines the evolution of Ludoscope, a state-of-the-art level generator used in the games Unexplored 1 and 2. In over a decade, it has grown in complexity, with Unexplored 2?s generator now containing over 20K rewrite rules. We investigate how Ludomotion addressed maintenance challenges, and how this impacts procedural level design. Our approach combines: 1) a bottom-up analysis of Ludoscope; and 2) a top-down exploration of a generic DSL for ?level blueprints?. This paper contributes the first step and discusses ongoing work on a reusable framework for procedural level design.

      "authors": "Seth Cooper and Mahsa Bazzaz",
      "abstract": "When generating game levels, it is desirable for them to be completable. Depending on the designer?s goals, it may also be desirable to generate levels without softlocks. A softlock is a situation where the player has not won or lost, but cannot make progress toward the goal, and is thus stuck (unless they reset, or possibly lose the level). In this work we present a constraint-based approach to generating 2D tile-based levels that are completable and do not have areas where the player can get stuck. The approach uses a constraint-based reachability categorization of locations during level generation. This categorization can be used to prevent softlocks by ensuring that all locations reachable going forward from the start of the level are also reachable going backward from the goal, unless they are sinks (areas where the player will inevitably lose the level, e.g. falling off the bottom). Using this approach, it is also possible to intentionally generate levels with softlocks and to repair levels to remove softlocks.",

In this paper, a novel approach utilizing PCG is presented that aims to generate racetracks with the primary objective of ensuring fairness and balanced gameplay regardless of the player?s vehicle choice. The proposed framework comprises three distinct phases: During the first phase, modular racetrack segments are procedurally generated in order to enhance track variety, which plays a crucial role in providing an engaging gaming experience. In the second phase, AI car controllers are employed on different vehicles to simulate driving through all generated racetrack segments, gathering various statistics. This step allows for the collection of data that will inform decision-making during the final assembly of the complete racetrack. Finally, in the third phase, the collected data is utilized to select and assemble the most suitable racetrack segments, ensuring fairness for all simulated vehicle types by avoiding any potential unfair advantages or disadvantages. To further support this innovative framework, its theoretical foundation is explored, and detailed explanations of each step involved in the process are provided.",

Thematic elements of games are notoriously difficult for AI systems to understand and manipulate, however, and often rely on large amounts of hand-written interpretations and knowledge. In this paper we present a technique which connects game embeddings, a recent method for modelling game dynamics from log data, and word embeddings, which models semantic information about language. We explain two different approaches for using game embeddings in this way, and show evidence that game embeddings enhance the linguistic translations of game concepts from one theme to another, opening up exciting new possibilities for reasoning about the thematic elements of games in the future.",

      "year": 2024,
      "authors": "Shaad Alaka, Rafael Bidarra",
      "abstract": "Procedural Content Generation (PCG) has long been proposed as an answer to the increased workload imposed on designers of virtual worlds, although often at the cost of controllability and expression of designer intent. Mixed-initiative approaches promise to overcome this, and valid proposals have been made of mixed-initiative editors, e.g. driven by the Wave Function Collapse (WFC) algorithm. However, stock WFC operates on a simple tileset without any hierarchy or semantic clustering, preventing designers from fluently expressing level of detail, leaving the constraint solving burden partly on them instead of on the algorithm. Hierarchical Semantic Wave Function Collapse (HSWFC) claims to solve this problem by hierarchically structuring its tileset of semantic tiles, featuring meta-tiles that can undergo intermediate collapses. Employing an HSWFC interactive editor offering such features may significantly reduce cognitive load and, thus, make such an editor more appealing for widespread use. We describe a user study to test this hypothesis, by comparing and discussing the cognitive load assessed on designers using either a stock WFC-driven editor or an HSWFC-driven editor. Our findings confirm that there is a significant reduction in cognitive load when the HSWFC editor is employed in comparison to the stock WFC editor.",

      "abstract": "When generating levels, algorithmically evaluating the results is essential. In this paper, we looked at predicting a level?s difficulty and enjoyment. Past work has approached this problem for puzzle games like Sudoku by analyzing the characteristics of the initial level, the solved level, and the process that led to that solution. In this work, we examined a set of heuristics for Roguelike levels and their solutions, and their relationship to subjective player ratings of the levels. We gathered ratings of difficulty and enjoyment of levels in a study with 143 players. We ran an ablation study on the set of heuristics to find the best combination of heuristics for predicting difficulty and enjoyment with a linear regression model, and found solution path-based heursitics performed well. However, these models did not outperform a simple baseline for predicting enjoyment. Jaccard similarity on paths?a method we have not seen used in the field of game AI?was a useful predictor of difficulty. Testing proximity to enemies across a solution path is the only heuristic needed to predict how enjoyable a level will be.",

By incorporating unexpected elements, games can create a sense of excitement and curiosity, leading to a more immersive and enjoyable experience. In this paper, we propose a framework for generating levels in 2D platform games with embedded surprising content. Building upon the VCL (Violation of Expectation, Caught Off Guard, and Learning) model, we use it as a conceptual foundation to curate surprise by altering specific game elements (called metrics) during the level generation process. We developed a tile-based parametric level generator for Super Mario Bros., creating customized levels based on metrics such as linearity, enemy density, and pattern variation, among others. 393 participants in our study played 2 generated levels, with the first setting expectations and the second intentionally violating them by altering chosen metrics. By comparing player responses and gameplay data with the VCL model, we explore the phenomenon of surprise in games. Our findings reveal statistically significant correlations between certain metrics and player responses, teasing at the potential for automatically generating surprising levels in 2D platform games.",

      "authors": "Shaad Alaka and Rafael Bidarra",
      "abstract": "There are few proposals to improve the interactivity and control of wave function collapse (WFC) in a mixed-initiative setting. Moreover, most WFC algorithm variants operate on an simple, unstructured set of tiles. This limitation on the level of control provided to designers hampers their creative work in various ways. We propose Hierarchical Semantic WFC, a generalized approach to WFC that organizes its tile-set into a hierarchy akin to a taxonomy induced by the relation ?consists-of?. In such a hierarchical structure, abstract tiles (i.e. non-leaf nodes) can represent the first sketchy intentions of a designer (e.g. forest, urban, desert,...) This allows a designer to interactively collapse a given area into abstract tiles, while subsequently, (and repeatedly, if desired) WFC can resolve each area into a variety of particular instances, by further collapsing it into (a valid combination of) its children tiles (whether leaves or not). We identify how this subtle tile-set change affects the whole WFC algorithm, describe a number of novel exploratory and interactive functions that this enables, and showcase these with a variety of examples generated with our prototype implementation. We conclude that these new mixed-initiative content generation methods can considerably reduce design iteration times and improve the assistance given to designers in expressing their creative intent.",

      "abstract": "The open-world sandbox game Minecraft is well-known for applying a wide array of procedural content generation techniques to create unique and expansive game environments. However, procedurally generated buildings are absent in the Minecraft world, thus players must build their own structures to flesh out their worlds. This build process can be extremely time-consuming and appeals to more creatively-inclined players. To aid players in this process, we introduce a tool combining interactive evolution with latent variable evolution to evolve procedurally generated Minecraft structures to a player?s aesthetic choices. We employ two separate neural network models to generate structures: a 3D generative model for generating the structure design and an encoding model for applying Minecraft textures to the structure?s voxels. We evaluate this tool with a user study incorporating an online interface that allows participants to select, evolve, and guide a population of these generated 3D structures towards a specific design goal.",

Datasets of game levels are also hard to come by, potentially taxing the abilities of these data-hungry models.

An edit at any resolution instantly transfers to the other resolutions. As upscaling requires inventing features that might not be present at lower resolutions, we train neural networks to reproduce these features. We introduce a neural network architecture that is capable of not only learning upscaling but also giving higher priority to less frequent tiles. To investigate the potential of this tool and guide further development, we conduct a qualitative study with 3 designers to understand how they use it.

Expressivity is secured through quality-diversity search which can provide the designer with a broad variety of level layouts to choose from. Finally, the generator is general-purpose as it can produce layouts based on different types of static grid structures or as free-form, curved structures through an adaptive Voronoi diagram that is evolved along with the level itself. The method is tested on a variety of design specifications and grid types, and results show that even with complex design constraints or malleable grids the algorithm can produce a broad variety of levels.",

Instead of creating levels by hand, level designers make use of generators that automate the creation process. However, iteratively improving a level?s design requires encoding generators of adventures, puzzles and encounters in notations that bear little resemblance to generated content. Raising the level quality is difficult, because it is hard to reason about bugs that can manifest inside generated content. We take the position that debugging requires special attention. We argue that advancing the area calls for tools and debugging techniques that speed up procedural level design and empower level designers. We propose exploring how Domain-Specific Languages can help in authoring a level?s design, validating the generator?s code, and debugging issues in generated content. We introduce Mental Maps, a visual language that expresses the spacial relations between rooms, objects and paths. We discuss how Mental Maps can serve as generator blueprints before the generation happens, and as debugging lenses for projecting issues afterwards.",

We train an agent to optimize each of these tasks to explore the capabilities of previous research in PCGRL.

      "abstract": "Search-based procedural content generation (PCG) is a well-known method for level generation in games. Its key advantage is that it is generic and able to satisfy functional constraints.

In this paper, we introduce mutation models, a new type of iterative level generator based on machine learning. We train a model to imitate the evolutionary process and use the trained model to generate levels. This trained model is able to modify noisy levels sequentially to create better levels without the need for a fitness function during inference. We evaluate our trained models on a 2D maze generation task. We compare several different versions of the method: training the models either at the end of evolution (normal evolution) or every 100 generations (assisted evolution) and using the model as a mutation function during evolution. Using the assisted evolution process, the final trained models are able to generate mazes with a success rate of 99% and high diversity of 86%. The trained model is many times faster than the evolutionary process it was trained on. This work opens the door to a new way of learning level generators guided by an evolutionary process, meaning automatic creation of generators with specifiable constraints and objectives that are fast enough for runtime deployment in games.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a method to synthesize open world game level that trigger spatial exploration. We benefited from recent work that had proposed game level design patterns to evoke curiosity, and we propose an approach to automatically synthesizing game levels in order to encourage players to pursue designer-specified exploration goals. We started by creating a dataset of level assets, based on the four design patterns that evoke curiosity-driven exploration in games (reaching extreme points, resolving visual obstructions, out-of-place objects, and understanding spatial connections). We annotated the assets in our dataset with spatial exploration measurements. We then formulated game level design as an optimization problem and we solved this problem by implementing a reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo method. We demonstrate our method's ability to synthesize game level variations with different spatial exploration and level design decisions. Finally, a user study showed that our approach can automatically synthesize game levels, encouraging a certain amount of spatial exploration by players.",

One of the inherent limitations of the original WFC is that it often requires users to understand its inner workings, and possibly make their own ad-hoc mods, to achieve satisfactory results. Besides distracting from your creative task, this strongly reduces the algorithm's effective usefulness to a small group of technical users. We propose miWFC, a novel mixed-initiative approach to WFC aimed at overcoming these drawbacks. Its main focus is on providing intuitive control to its users, in a way that matches their usual creative workflow. Among its main features, this approach provides (i) interactive navigation through design history, including controlled backtracking, (ii) precise manual editing on the output for direct expression of design intent, and (iii) interactive manipulation of tile weights, to tweak the global appearance of the output. We evaluated a prototype implementation of our approach among game artists and other creative professionals, and concluded that its features were largely considered useful and supportive of their creative work.",

In this paper, we build on these methods by training VAEs to learn a sequential model of segment generation such that generated segments logically follow from prior segments. By further combining the VAE with a classifier that determines whether to place the generated segment to the top, bottom, left or right of the previous segment, we obtain a pipeline that enables the generation of arbitrarily long levels that progress in any of these four directions and are composed of segments that logically follow one another. In addition to generating more coherent levels of non-fixed length, this method also enables implicit blending of levels from separate games that do not have similar orientation. We demonstrate our approach using levels from Super Mario Bros., Kid Icarus and Mega Man, showing that our method produces levels that are more coherent than previous latent variable-based approaches and are capable of blending levels across games.",

      "abstract": "Dungeon generation is among the oldest problems in procedural content generation. Creating the spatial aspects of a dungeon requires three steps: random generation of rooms and sizes, placement of these rooms inside a fixed area, and connecting rooms with passageways. This paper uses a series of integer linear constraints, solved by a satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solver, to performthe placement step. Separation constraints ensure dungeon rooms do not intersect and maintain a minimum fixed separation. Designers can specify control lines, and dungeon rooms will be placed within a fixed distance of these control lines. Generation timesvary with number of rooms and constraints, but are often very fast. Spatial distribution of solutions tend to have hot spots, but issurprisingly uniform given the underlying complexity of the solver. The approach demonstrates the effectiveness of a declarative approach to dungeon layout generation, where designers can express desired intent, and the SMT solver satisfies this if possible.",

      "abstract": "Procedural generation of rooms aims to create virtual environments that mimic common patterns found in real-world indoor locations, like offices or bedrooms. Graph-based models (e.g. factor graphs or Bayesian networks) have often been used to represent typical location’s objects and their occurrence likelihood (nodes), as well as their inter-relationships (edges). Previous methods have struggled to represent object semantics in their graph nodes; specifically, they fail to fully and effectively support notions as abstractions (e.g. generic seat instead of chair) and replication (e.g. cups instead of cup). We propose a generalized representation and use for object semantics that overcomes the above limitations of graph-based models in the procedural generation of rooms. This node representation handles semantics as attributes, and clearly distinguishes the contribution of the attributes on the node from the potential effects of the node on the whole graph. We illustrate the additional expressive power of the resulting graph-based model for room generation, and show that it subsumes previous models as particular cases.",

Additionally, this method can provide several mazes which satisfy the given desired properties allowing designers to choose the best maze and use it to build game content for a game level.

We propose a novel metric called Metric of Added Detail (MAD) that indicates if a rule adds or removes detail with respect to its phase in the transformation pipeline, and Specifcation Analysis Reporting (SAnR) for expressing level properties and analyzing how qualities evolve in level generation histories. We demonstrate MAD and SAnR using a prototype of a level generator called Ludoscope Lite.

Another assumption is that, given levels created by expert designers, it is possible to extract and transfer their structural properties to new levels. To make it an automatic process, in this paper we first propose a graph-based representation of Super Mario Bros levels to encode their structure. Next, to abstract the structural elements we extend an algorithm for learning a graph grammar, SubdueGL, to produce a stochastic graph grammar. Then we describe our work in progress on generating new levels from graphs produced by the graph grammar.",

      "abstract": "This article focuses on games that can tailor the pro- vided game experience to the individual player (personalised games), typically by effectively utilising player models. A particular challenge in this regard, is utilising player models for assessing online (i.e., while the game is being played) and unobtrusively which game adaptations are appropriate. In this article, we propose an approach for personalising the space in which a game is played (i.e., levels) – to the end of tailoring the experienced challenge to the individual player during actual play of the game. Our approach specifically considers two persisting design challenges, namely implicit user feedback and high risk of user abandonment. Our contribution to this end is proposing a clear separation between (intelligent) offline exploration and (safety-conscious) online exploitation. We are presently assessing the effectiveness of the developed approach in an actual video game: Infinite Mario Bros. [18]. To this end, we have enhanced the game such that its process for procedural-content generation allows the game spaces (i.e., levels) to be personalised during play of the game. We use data from intelligent offline exploration to determine both a model of experienced challenge as well as safe level design parameters for use on new players. Online, we use a gradient ascent algorithm with designer-specified domain knowledge to select the next set of level design parameters.",

Our approach comprises a shape data flow character and introduces some novel features, including recursion, parametric flow, and flow filtering. The main development model consists of encapsulating basic operations into semantically-rich, reusable components that can be more easily assembled using filters.

      "abstract": "Current game worlds often fall short in providing consistency between the visual representation of the world and the way it feels, behaves, and reacts. This problem partly originates from the goal-oriented and cost-effective nature of the game development process, which mostly favors ad hoc solutions for one particular game, rather than investing in concepts like reusability and emergent gameplay. In broader terms, we observe that game worlds miss semantics, and we argue that its deployment has the potential to bring about the consistency missing in their content. Therefore, wepresent a novel approach aimed at enriching virtual entities in game worlds with information about their roles, how they relate to others, and how they can affect and interact with players, NPCs, and with each other. We discuss several requirements to achieve these goals, and introduce a semantic model to represent game worlds. In order to support and validate this model, we have developed Entika, a framework to facilitate the deployment of semantics during game development, as well as its maintenance during run-time. Furthermore, we briefly discuss several applications that demonstrate the power of this semantic model for game worlds. After careful evaluation of our semantic game world model and framework, we conclude that a semantically rich world representation can substantially assist designers in creating much more consistent game worlds.",

      "abstract": "The use of procedural content generation to support adaptive games is starting to gain momentum in current research. However, there are still many open issues to tackle, namely the reusability of methodologies. Our research focuses on reusable and generic methods for linking the procedural generation of 3D game worlds with gameplay, as measured by player modelling techniques. As the interface for that link, we propose the use of gameplay semantics, a knowledge representation technique that allows our case-based generator to match content to player models. We present and discuss the implementation of our proposed method in an existing game, Stunt Playground. Gameplay semantics is created by designers in a generic way and is then used to procedurally generate player-matching Stunt Playground gameworlds, both atthedesignandgamestage. Current results show that our approach can automatically create such adaptive game content, thus effectively bridging game world designers, procedural generation and gameplay.",

The resulting automated process is highly controllable: it is a perfect match for a mixed-initiative approach to level generation where human and computer collaborate in designing levels.

      "abstract": "Designing virtual game worlds is often a long and labor-intensive process. Moreover, when a game world needs to be slightly altered in appearance, the entire process needs to be repeated, or will at least require some repetitious tasks. Ideally, when the same game world is needed under different circumstances (e.g. in another season, before and after a war, in prosperous or poor economic conditions), the designer should be aided in this process using procedural generation techniques. We propose an approach for the specification of procedural filters that describe how (parts of) virtual worlds should be customized to fit a particular situation based on their semantics and the conditions of the situation. This description will guide the customization process by triggering and parametrizing, among others, procedural instructions that can change the appearance of the virtual world. We will discuss how the generic nature of this approach, which favors reusability, and its integration with semantics, which increases the intuitiveness of the design process, can eliminate many of the repetitious tasks involved in performing these actions manually. We describe an implementation of this approach that shows how some simple procedural filters can i) age an urban environment and simulate the effects of poor living conditions on the look of that environment, and ii) apply a party atmosphere to an ordinary office scene.",

      "abstract": "Procedural generation of virtual worlds is a promising alternative to classical manual modelling approaches, which usually require a large amount of effort and expertise. However, it suffers from a number of issues; most importantly, the lack of user control over the generation process and its outcome. Because of this, the result of a procedural method is highly unpredictable, rendering it almost unusable for virtual world designers. This paper focuses on providing user control to deliver an outcome consistent with designer’s intent. For this, we introduce semantic constraints, a flexible concept to express high-level designer’s intent in intuitive terms as e.g. line of sight. Our constraint evaluation method is capable of detecting the context in which such a constraint is specified, automatically adapting to surrounding features of the virtual world. From experiments performed within our prototype modelling system, we can conclude that semantic constraints are another step forward in making procedural generation of virtual worlds more controllable and accessible to non-specialist designers.",

      "abstract": "Because of the increasing detail and size of virtual worlds, designers are more and more urged to consider employing procedural methods to alleviate part of their modeling work. However, such methods are often unintuitive to use, difficult to integrate, and provide little user control, making their application far from straightforward. In our declarative modeling approach, designers are provided with a more productive and simplified virtual world modeling workflow that matches better with their iterative way of working. Using interactive procedural sketching, they can quickly layout a virtual world, while having proper user control at the level of large terrain features. However, in practice, designers require a finer level of control. Integrating procedural techniques with manual editing in an iterative modeling workflow is an important topic that has remained relatively unaddressed until now. This paper identifies challenges of this integration and discusses approaches to combine these methods in such a way that designers can freely mix them, while the virtual world model is kept consistent during all modifications. We conclude that overcoming the challenges mentioned, for ex- ample in a declarative modeling context, is instrumental to achieve the much desired adoption of procedural modeling in mainstream virtual world modeling.",

      "abstract": "Players begin games at different skill levels and develop their skill at different rates so that even the best-designed games are uninterestingly easy for some players and frustratingly difficult for others. A proposed answer to this challenge is Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA), a general category of approaches that alter games during play, in response to player performance. However, nearly all these techniques are focused on basic parameter tweaking, while the difficulty of many games is connected to aspects that are more challenging to adjust dynamically, such as level design. Further, most DDA techniques are based on designer intuition, which may not reflect actual play patterns. Responding to these challenges, we present Polymorph, which employs techniques from level generation and machine learning to understand game component difficulty and player skill, dynamically constructing a 2D platformer game with continually-appropriate challenge. We believe this will create a play experience that is unique because the changes are both personalized and structural, while also providing an example of a promising new research and development approach.",

Two representations for strategy game maps are devised, along with a number of objectives relating to predicted player experience. A multiobjective evolutionary algorithm is used for searching the space of maps for candidates that satisfy pairs of these objectives. As the objectives are inherently partially conflicting, the algorithm generates Pareto fronts showing how these objectives can be balanced. Such fronts are argued to be a valuable tool for designers looking to balance various design needs. Choosing appropriate points (manually or automatically) on the Pareto fronts, maps can be found that exhibit good map design according to specified criteria, and could either be used directly in e.g. an RTS game or form the basis for further human design.",
